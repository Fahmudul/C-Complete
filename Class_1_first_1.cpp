// Compiler And Interpreter
/*
Compiler
* It takes the full source code written in high level language and then translate it to machine language code. Which is a set of instruction for the sytem processor to execute

* compiler runing involves these steps including
1. Lexical Analysis: Breaks down the code into basic tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).
2. Syntax Analysis: Checks if the code adheres to the grammar rules of the language.
3. Semantic Analysis: Ensures the code makes logical sense and there are no type mismatches.
4. Code Generation: Translates the verified and analyzed code into machine code for the target platform.

*   MOST IMPORTANT FOR FILE NAMING "NEVER USE SPACES IN FILE NAME!!!!!"

Process:
1. Line-by-Line Translation: The interpreter reads each line of code, translates it to an intermediate representation (like bytecode), and executes it.
2. Dynamic Execution: The translation and execution happen simultaneously, allowing for more interactive development.

*** Function: A preprocessor is a program that processes a file (usually source code) before it's fed to the compiler. It performs text-based transformations on the code according to predefined rules.
